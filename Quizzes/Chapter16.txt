{
	Most modern servlet containers such as Tomcat provide a built-in way to restrict access to       certain parts of a web application. This is known as ________________.
	container-managed security #
}

{
	The process of asking users to identify themselves before they can access restricted portions of a web site is referred to as _________________________.
	authentication #
}

{
	You use the ________________ file to specify the type of authentication that’s going to be used by the application.
	web.xml #
}

{
	Instead of using a dialog box to request the username and password, ________________ authentication uses a web form.
	form-based #
}

{
	When you use form-based authentication, you can use ________________ to code the login form that’s displayed when someone attempts to access a restricted resource.
	html #
}

{
	To restrict access to a web resource, you add a ______________ element to the web.xml file.
	security-constraint #
	auth-constraint
	security-role
	web-resource-collection
}

{
	Which of the following is not included in a security constraint?
	the URL pattern for the restricted resources
	the authorized roles for accessing the restricted resources
	the authorized usernames for accessing the restricted resources #
}

{
	The security realm provides the authorized
	usernames and passwords
	usernames and roles
	usernames, passwords, and roles #
	passwords and roles
}

{
	By default, Tomcat stores usernames, passwords, and roles in the
	the web.xml file
	the server.xml file
	a database
	the tomcat-users.xml file #
}

{
	When an application uses basic authentication,
	the username and password are encrypted before being sent to the server
	a dialog box automatically prompts the user for a username and password #
	the usernames and passwords are stored in the tomcat-users.xml file
	the web.xml file provides the path for the login page
}

{
	Since this type of authentication does not automatically encrypt the username and password before sending them to the server, it is typically used over a secure connection.
	basic authentication
	form-based authentication
	digest authentication
	both a and b #
	none of the above
}

{
	An interface that’s used to authenticate users so they can access web resources that have been restricted is called a
	realm #
	constraint
	role
	none of the above
}

{
	A user can be associated with
	zero roles
	one role
	multiple roles
	all of the above #
}

{
	For simple web applications, the ________________ provides a quick and easy way to implement a realm.
	JDBCRealm
	UserDatabaseRealm #
	DataSourceRealm
	none of the above
}

{
	For more serious web applications, the ________________ provides a way to access usernames, passwords, and roles that have been stored in a relational database.
	JDBCRealm #
	UserDatabaseRealm
	DataSourceRealm
	none of the above
}

{
	The ____________________ provides a way to use connection pooling to access usernames, passwords, and roles that have been stored in a database.
	JDBCRealm
	UserDatabaseRealm
	DataSourceRealm #
	none of the above
}
