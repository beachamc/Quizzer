{
	When a browser makes an initial attempt to communicate with a server over a secure connection, the server authenticates itself by
	providing a digital secure certificate to the client #
	decrypting all data
	confirming the identity of the client
	authorizing the client

	A digital secure certificate is provided
	usually for a fee from a certificate authority #
	free from a certificate authority

{
	The maximum SSL strength for an application’s connections is determined by
	the SSL methods that you use
	the certification authority
	the registration authority
	the digital secure certificate #
}

{
	Once you establish a secure connection, the application
	returns to a non-secure connection for subsequent requests

	continues to use a secure connection until until a relative URL specifies a non-secure connection

	SSL strength can depend on
