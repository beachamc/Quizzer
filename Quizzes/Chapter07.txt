{
	Keeping track of users as they move around a web site is known as ________________.
	session tracking #
}

{
	By default, the servlet API uses a/an ________________ to store a session ID in each browser.
	cookie #
}

{
	To store the data for each session, the server creates a/an ________________.
	session object #
}

{
	It is not recommended to implement session tracking by using URL encoding, because it can lead to session ________________.
	hijacking #
}

{
	To create a cookie, you create an instance of the ________________ class.
	Cookie #
}

{
	________________ cookies are stored on the user’s computer and are available for subsequent sessions.
	Persistent #
}

{
	________________ cookies are deleted when the session ends.
	Per-session #
}

{
	You can use the ________________ method of the response object to add a cookie to the computer that made the request.
	addCookie #
}

{
	To get an array of all the cookies stored by the browser, you use the ________________ method of the request object.
	getCookies #
}

{
	Since it can be tedious to loop through an array of cookies whenever you want to get the value for one cookie, it is common to place the code that loops through the array of cookies in a/an ________________ class.

{
	A session object is created
 	every time a browser makes a request for a web page
 	every time a browser requests a servlet
 	every time a browser requests a jsp
	the first time a browser makes a request to a site #
}

{
	A servlet can retrieve the current session object by using the getSession method of the
 	HttpSession class
 	response object
	the request object #
 	the ServletContext object
}

{
	The current session object is available
 	only to JSPs
 	only to servlets
	to both servlets and JSPs #
}

{
	Which of the following statements causes an error?
	String name = session.getAttribute("name"); #
 	Book book = (Book) session.getAttribute("book");
 	session.setAttribute("name", "Ted Andrews");
 	session.removeAttribute("name");
}

{
	Cookies are stored
 	in a database
 	on the web server that sent the cookie
 	on the web server that created the cookie
	on the client #

{
	Persistent cookies
 	are removed after the session ends

 	can’t be deleted
 	are often called hidden fields

	URL rewriting #
 	URL encoding
 	hidden fields
 	cookies
}

{
	The advantages of using hidden fields over URL rewriting to pass parameters from a browser to the server are
 	a hidden field can contain spaces and other special characters that are difficult to work with when using URL rewriting
 	the user can see the parameters by using the browser to look at the page’s source code
 	no limit to the number of characters that can be stored in a hidden field
 	both a and b
	both a and c #

	When you set an attribute in the request object, the attributes are ________________.

{
	When you set an attribute in the session object, the attributes are

{
	Typical uses for cookies are

 	to customize pages that display info like weather reports, sports scores, etc.
